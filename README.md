# BikeSharing
Using Tableau to analyze and visualize bikeshare data in NY. 

## Objective:
The main objective is to show investors the most important relevant data from the bike-sharing program in New York, so that they will invest in the Des Moines bike-sharing business.

In order to do this the following questions will need to be answerd:
1. How variable is bike utilization? 
2. What might the key costs be in a bike-share business?
3. What is the breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers?
4. What are the peak hours for bike rentals? 
5. What are the highest-traffic locations? 
6. When and where do people use Citi Bike?
7. Whats the average duration of a trip by age?
8. Which genders utilize bike-sharing?
9. How does the Citi Bike program work during the month of August in New York City?
10. What are the most popular starting and stopping stations?
11. How often are bikes used? How often do they need repairs?



1. Import citibike dataset into Jupyter NB. 
2. Use Pandas to convert `tripduration` column from an integer to a datatime datatype.
3. Export converted citibike dataset to a csv file. 
4. Import the dataset into Tableau.
5. Build various visualizations and adding interactive filters
    a. Thelength of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
    b. The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
    c. The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
6. Add these worksheets and dashboards to a Tableau story that details the overall analysis to pitch to investors.
