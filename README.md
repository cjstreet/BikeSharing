# BikeSharing
Using Tableau to analyze and visualize bikeshare data in NY. 


(1) what is the breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers, and (2) what are the peak hours for bike rentals? These answers will help you broker a strategic conversation with investors. There are more questions to ask the data, however. For example, what are the highest-traffic locations? Understanding both when and where people use Citi Bike will help you plan your pilot in Des Moines.

Now we're going to use the data to find the most popular stations in the city for starting a bike journey. Top Starting Locations.
But where do they drop off the bikes? Top Ending Locations

What can the data tell us about the riders themselves? breakdown of riders by gender, 

Let's take a look at the average duration of a bike ride, by age.

What might the key costs be in a bike-share business? 
A likely concern of investors is the cost of bike upkeep. The bikes used most frequently will probably be the ones that require the most maintenance, so we'll need to determine which bikes have the highest sum of "Number of Rides."

Now that we've found the number of trips per bike during the month of August, we should figure out how long those rides are and if there are bikes that need more attention than others. We'll use the bike ID as a metric for this part of the analysis and create a packed bubbles visualization.

How Variable Is Bike Utilization?

As we begin to build our dashboard, consider our main objective: we want to show investors the most important relevant data so that they will support the Des Moines bike-sharing business.
