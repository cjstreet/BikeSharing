# BikeSharing
Using Tableau to analyze and visualize bikeshare data in NY. 

## Objective:
How variable is bike utilization? What might the key costs be in a bike-share business?

The main objective is to show investors the most important relevant data from the bike-sharing program in New York, so that they will invest in the Des Moines bike-sharing business.


1. Import citibike dataset into Jupyter NB. 
2. Use Pandas to convert `tripduration` column from an integer to a datatime datatype.
3. Export converted citibike dataset to a csv file. 
4. Import the dataset into Tableau.
5. Build various visualizations and adding interactive filters
6. Add these worksheets and dashboards to a Tableau story that details the overall analysis to pitch to investors.

Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.




Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.




(1) what is the breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers, and (2) what are the peak hours for bike rentals? These answers will help you broker a strategic conversation with investors. There are more questions to ask the data, however. For example, what are the highest-traffic locations? Understanding both when and where people use Citi Bike will help you plan your pilot in Des Moines.

Now we're going to use the data to find the most popular stations in the city for starting a bike journey. Top Starting Locations.
But where do they drop off the bikes? Top Ending Locations

What can the data tell us about the riders themselves? breakdown of riders by gender, 

Let's take a look at the average duration of a bike ride, by age.

 
A likely concern of investors is the cost of bike upkeep. The bikes used most frequently will probably be the ones that require the most maintenance, so we'll need to determine which bikes have the highest sum of "Number of Rides."

Now that we've found the number of trips per bike during the month of August, we should figure out how long those rides are and if there are bikes that need more attention than others. We'll use the bike ID as a metric for this part of the analysis and create a packed bubbles visualization.
